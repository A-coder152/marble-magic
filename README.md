# MAGE OF MAGIC MARBLES

This is such a dumb project man it's so stupid why did I ever think this was gonna work out

uhmmm moving on

## main attacking concept

I have to give this its own section cause its so weird

you have the bag of marbles, each turn 4 are randomly chosen, you don't know what they are. every turn you choose 2 marbles to attack with.

you first have a "test turn" to test out 2 marbles and see what their impact is, then a real turn where what you do counts. so based on the test turn results, you have to think if it was good enough or if you'll risk it for the other two marbles.

## HOW 2 PLAY (more detailed)

In a fight, you choose two marbles out of the four and hope for the best. However, the wizard's time travelling abilities give him a unique advantage. You have a "Test Round" that allows you to see the effect of the marbles before actually doing anything. Use this test round to find out which marbles are strong... and which ones are duds.

Your bag contains all your marbles. Here you'll see all the marbles in your bag, as well as how many you have. To see what each marble does, hover over it.

In the shop, you get to buy new marbles, or sell marbles from your bag. Just click on the marble, make sure you have enough couns, and your bag is now stronger!

(note: some marbles are so bad, you can buy them for negative coins, but selling them will cost you. be careful of the wholesale bargains.)



## Lore

Once upon a time, 
a magical wizard lived peacefully in the land. 

He was popular for being kind, 

but also for his strange magic practices.

Hus favorite item was his bag of magic marbles.

They could do all sorts of things, 

and were super useful in dangeous encounters.

He also can time travel, but he doesn't like using it a lot.

Don't ask him why. 

Those who did got hit with a few marbles in the head. 

Some more magical than others.



However, one day, he was kidnapped by a trio of criminals

called "THE FELT FEAR".

They hated this wizard's marbles, 

as their unique magic kept the cities safe.

They came up with a plan: to mix up the wizard's marbles,

so that he wouldn't recognize what they did.

When the wizard woke up, he relaized the trouble he was in.

But he remembered his time traveling abilities.

So he devised a plan:

He would travel in time to see what the marbles do,

then use that information to strategize a more powerful attack.

Help the wizard escape THE FELT FEAR's grip!
